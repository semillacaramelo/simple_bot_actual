# Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

The bot connects to Deriv.com using a custom API interface. It supports trading in both demo and real environments via environment variable configuration. The trading strategy involves computing three moving averages (short, medium, long) on market data from multiple timeframes to generate buy/sell signals for 1-minute trades.

## Key Modules

### API Integration

The `deriv_connector.py` module implements a robust API connector that uses environment variables for configuration, handles ping/pong messages, and manages reconnections.

### Data Fetching

The `data_fetcher.py` module retrieves both real-time and historical market data, ensuring proper error handling and caching mechanisms.

### Strategy Implementation

The `moving_average.py` module calculates three moving averages over three timeframes and generates trading signals based on their intersections or divergences.

### Order Execution and Risk Management

The `order_executor.py` module executes trades, and the `risk_manager.py` module manages risk and enforces trading limits.

### Logging and Monitoring

The `logger.py` module integrates detailed logging, and the `performance.py` module tracks and analyzes performance metrics.

## Deployment and Testing

Provide clear documentation for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the bot. Include unit tests and integration tests to ensure the system works as expected in live environments.
